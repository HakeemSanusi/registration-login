- Logout functionality with session invalidation
- Protection against common web attacks (e.g., CSRF)

Technologies:

- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- BCrypt password encryption

Purpose:

This project showcases a basic implementation of Spring Security for user authentication and authorization. It serves as a starting point for more complex applications requiring robust security measures.
